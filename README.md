#### Bikes Share Analysis

Welcome to my project, I used Pythonas a tool of  delving into data associated with bike share systems in three prominent U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The journey involves crafting code to effortlessly import this data and unveil intriguing insights through the calculation of descriptive statistics. Additionally, I provided a dynamic script that gracefully accepts user input, providing an interactive terminal experience for the presentation of these valuable statistical findings.





#### Description

This project employs Python to gain insights from U.S. bikeshare data, offering an interactive environment that empowers users to select and filter datasets from three major cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) for in-depth analysis. I made sure that the python file is self explanatory you can check it with documentation for each step. 

#### Files used

bikeshare.py chicago.csv new_york_city.csv washington.csv included in the gitignore file. However the analysis was mainly in bikesshare python file you can see how I did the analysis.
